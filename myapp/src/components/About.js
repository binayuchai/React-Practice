            <h1>About Us</h1>
            Any explanation we give is going to go right over your head (no offense intended, it’s just the reality). There is so much to learn at first, and jumping into a more difficult environment right at the start is not the best way to go about it.

    Recommend strongly that you work with the course track material right to the end so your knowledge base can grow. You will be greatly empowered by then, and better able to understand and follow the directions others are going to give you. And, you might discover for yourself some of the inner workings of the browser, the DOM, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

    Now here are three links that are going to be, as I said earlier, over your head. But give them a read anyway, and see if you don’t better understand the console object and why it does not work as expected in IE.
